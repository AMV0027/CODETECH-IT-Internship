**Documentation: Weather Forecast**

**Overview:**
This documentation provides an overview of a Weather Forecast web application built using HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. The application allows users to search for weather information by entering a location (e.g., city name). Upon submission, the application fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the current weather conditions, including temperature and description, along with an animated icon representing the weather condition.

**Tech Stack:**
- HTML: Hypertext Markup Language used for structuring web pages.
- JavaScript: A programming language used for adding interactivity to web pages.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling web applications.
- OpenWeatherMap API: Used to fetch weather data based on the user's search location.

**Files:**
- **index.html**: HTML file containing the structure and content of the web page.
- **script.js**: JavaScript file containing the logic for fetching weather data and updating the UI.
- **styles.css**: CSS file containing custom styles for the application (not included in the provided code).

**Functionality:**
1. **Search Form:**
   - Allows users to input a location (e.g., city name).
   - On submission, triggers a JavaScript function to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

2. **Weather Information Display:**
   - Displays the current weather information for the searched location.
   - Includes details such as city name, country, temperature, and weather description.
   - An animated icon representing the weather condition is displayed alongside the information.

**Styling:**
- Utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling, providing a responsive and visually appealing design.
- Custom CSS styles can be added to further customize the appearance of the application.

**JavaScript Logic:**
- Retrieves the search input and form elements from the HTML document.
- Listens for the form submission event and prevents the default behavior.
- Fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the user's input location.
- Updates the UI with the fetched weather information, including temperature, description, city name, country, and an animated weather icon.
- Handles errors if the API request fails, displaying an error message to the user.

**Running the Application:**
- Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
- Enter a location (e.g., city name) into the search input field.
- Press the "Search" button or hit Enter.
- View the current weather forecast for the searched location displayed on the page.

This documentation provides an overview of the structure, functionality, and technologies used in the Weather Forecast application, enabling understanding and further customization or enhancement of the codebase.
